Busboard
--------

Basic busboard with +/-12v input with polyfuses, ~50Hz low pass filter in an attempt to reduce noise coming from/going back towards the PSU, and power indicator LEDs.
5V is not provided, but 5V, CV, and Gate pins are all connected.
Supports up to 8 modules, *should* be able to handle up to 1A on each rail.

Probably overkill, but a bit nicer than stripboard!

Feel free to use as you wish.
